How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The best way to interepret what a customer may want in a program is to act as if you were the customer.  If you were to use the piece of software you are designing what features would you like to see? what annoyances would you like to mitigate? Luckily, in Scrum we don't have to guess too much thanks to "user stories". These pieces of information obtained from the end user allows for a window into what they are thinking the want in a piece of software, though some modifications or liberties may need to be taken for the sake of usability, flow, or ability of the software.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. This metaphor can be used as an approach to any large scale project and we see know better use of this than the BVC.  The BVC allows us to visually see the whole project broken down into small more managable pieces.  It is this thought process that i hope to take with me in my future career as a software develper. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Respecting others and listening to your team members. Another good way is to lend a hand when and where you can we are all in this together to develop the best software we can that fits the customers needs.
